✅ WHOOP integration for recovery-based adjustments
✅ Photo analysis integration for body composition
✅ Smart calorie adjustment based on recovery score
✅ Mock nutrition database ready for development
✅ LangChain + OpenAI agent framework set up
✅ Comprehensive Pydantic models with validation

## 💡 Technical Highlights

1. **Recovery-Aware Nutrition**
   - Low recovery (0-33) → +10-15% calories
   - Moderate recovery (34-66) → maintain or +5%
   - High recovery (67-100) → proceed as planned

2. **Lean Mass BMR Calculation**
   - More accurate than standard BMR formulas
   - Uses body composition from photo analysis
   - Formula: BMR = 370 + (21.6 * lean_mass_kg)

3. **Smart Macro Ratios**
   - Weight loss: Higher protein (0.35), moderate carbs (0.35), fats (0.30)
   - Muscle gain: Balanced protein (0.30), higher carbs (0.40), fats (0.30)
   - Adjusts based on training strain

4. **Agent Architecture**
   - LangChain for agent framework
   - OpenAI function calling for tool use
   - Structured output with Pydantic
   - Detailed reasoning in responses

## 🚀 What's Working

- Configuration system
- All tools (body metrics, recovery, nutrition DB)
- Macro calculator agent with LangChain
- Integration points defined
- Mock data for development
- Type-safe with Pydantic throughout

## 📝 Notes for Next Session

1. **Meal Planner Agent**:
   - Split macros evenly across meals initially
   - Can make breakfast smaller, dinner larger based on preferences
   - Validate sum of meals = target macros ± 5%

2. **Recipe Suggester Agent**:
   - Score recipes by macro match (weighted: protein > carbs > fats)
   - Consider prep time (penalize if > user's max time)
   - Filter strict (allergies, dietary restrictions)

3. **Workflow**:
   - Use LangGraph StateGraph for orchestration
   - Pass state between agents
   - Validate at each step
   - Fallback to rule-based if agent fails

4. **Testing**:
   - Mock all external APIs
   - Test with various goals (weight loss, muscle gain, etc.)
   - Test with dietary restrictions (vegan, keto, etc.)
   - Verify macro accuracy within 5%
